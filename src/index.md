# “Why Do You Hate Democracy?”

These are all good questions to ask many congresspeople and government leaders right now.

**You hate America, freedom, and democracy when you oppose the fundamental operation of democracy.** And Republican leaders have opposed democracy in these ways:

- **Republican leaders undermined faith in the election process** by spreading lies about election validity which never had any evidence, even after they were rejected by all courts.
- **President Trump and other MAGA leaders caused the disruption of the certification of electoral college votes** by inciting a mob with violent rhetoric and sent it to the Capitol, where it invaded the building, planted pipe bombs, and forced congress to flee for their safety. At least five people died as a result.
- **Some Republican congresspeople voted in support of rejecting the electoral college votes** from swing states, even though those electors were legally appointed and the election results were valid and confirmed.
- **President Trump continues to incite anti-government violence** by refusing to wholly reject the mob and to use language encouraging further insurrection.
- **Many Republican congresspeople currently do not want any consequences to President Trump** for this behavior that fundamentally undermines democracy, by removing him via the 25th amendment or by impeachment.

Because of this opposition to democracy, it’s correct to say that much Republican leadership hates America, hates democracy, and hates freedom.

## What can you do?

- Call your representative right now and urge them to support the bill to impeach President Trump. The web site [5 Calls](https://5calls.org/issue/impeach-trump-coup-insurrection) makes calling them easy.
- Talk to friends and family members to explain to them the danger of opposing democracy in the above ways.
- Do not vote to re-elect anyone who has opposed democracy in the above ways.
- Vote for leaders who support free and fair elections by opposing baseless claims of fraud and opposing gerrymandering.
